# AFmotor library

Here I just collect the libraries we might need to run our robot. 
Like the AFMotor.h for the old Adafruit motor shield that we can get cheap her in HCM.

It was created by Adafruit some years ago and quickly replaced by a I2C controlled motorshield with a seperate PWM generator.
